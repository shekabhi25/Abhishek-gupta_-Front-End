QUESTION  1:

Explain what the simple List component does.

The simple List component is a memoized list component that receives an array of objects with a text property as a prop. It maps the items prop to a list of SingleListItem components with a selected index state. When a SingleListItem is clicked, the selectedIndex state variable is updated.
